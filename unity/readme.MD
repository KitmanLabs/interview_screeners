Thanks for applying to Kitman Labs! Below you'll find our technical screener.

Once you've gone through this and sent us your unity project, we'll have someone review it. That step can take a few days. Once that's complete, we'll set up a phone call with one of the team.

# About the screener
- You should treat it like **real world production code**. You will be reviewed primarily on Code Quality including error case handling and design pattern usage and also the ease of usability of the team creator you make.
- We expect the task should take around three or four hours, but just let us know when you'll get it back to us and we'll be waiting. If you'd like to spend longer than three hours that's fine, but we don't expect you to - You have a life beyond this interview and that's completely reasonable!
- Hopefully it's a reasonably fun problem and shouldn't pose too much of a challenge. If you can give us a rough idea of when we should expect your answers, that would be great. We're pretty flexible on how you provide the answers. You can send over a link to a Github/Bitbucket repo, some folks send over a series of Github gists, others a zipped up copy of the code etc.

# The Goal
- Create a well written & designed “Drag and Drop” rugby team creator in Unity

# Detail
- You are given a JSON file with the data for a full squad of rugby players each having one or more positions they can play in, but may be injured and so in ineligible to play.
- The JSON data will include Player names, Position(s) they can play, injury status, a Star Rating and an Avatar Image URL.
- In Unity 5+ create a scrolling list UI with entries displaying the name of the players and an icon(s) for their positions (Icon image is provided).
- From this scrolling list players should be addable to the on field team.
- Players must only be addable to positions they can play in and cannot be added if injured
- Design a suitable UI layout for the goal
- Consider ease of dragging and dropping from the scrolling list
