## Head of Data Science Onsite Research Task
Magnitude Based Inference (MBI) is a novel statistical technique specific to the sports science industry. The development of MBI was motivated by some of the shortcomings of frequentist statistics when applied in this setting. We would like you to research this topic in advance of your interview. This task is to assess your critical thinking skills, there is no statistical analysis required.

We are looking for a short summary of MBI and a comparison to more traditional statistical methods. This should be in the form of a short presentation, submitted in advance of your interview. You should be able to present your opinion in 5-7 minutes. 

While you will be interviewed by a member of the Data Science Team, your presentation should aim to inform a non-technical Sports Science professional on the topic.
