# Kitman Labs Engineering Technical Screener Tests

When you [apply for](https://kitman.workable.com) one of the technical positions at [Kitman Labs](http://kitmanlabs.com), the first step we ask you to complete is one of the screening questions in this repository. We do this for a few reasons -

- CVs / Resumes are usually a [pretty poor indicator](http://blog.alinelerner.com/resumes-suck-heres-the-data/) of how someone will do
- Most people don't have a publicly visible body of open source code we can refer to
- A take home test like this allows people to do it in their own time and not have to take time off their current job
- It's lower pressure than having someone standing over your shoulder watching you code, so you can produce work closer to your personal standards.

## How we proceed after the screener is received

Once the screener has been submitted, we have one of the team review it. They're looking for things like readability of the code, separation of concerns, a reasonably thorough test suite etc. Depending on our workload at the time, this stage of the process can usually take a few days. If we're impressed with the work, we'll schedule a call to discuss your application further.
