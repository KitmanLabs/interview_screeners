# Interviewing for a technical position at Kitman Labs
When you [apply for](https://kitman.workable.com) one of the technical positions at [Kitman Labs](http://kitmanlabs.com), the first step we ask you to complete is one of the screening questions in this repository. We do this for a few reasons -

- CVs / Resumes are usually a [pretty poor indicator](http://blog.alinelerner.com/resumes-suck-heres-the-data/) of how someone will do
- Most people don't have a publicly visible body of open source code we can refer to (and even if they did, relying on open source can [introduce bias](https://www.ashedryden.com/blog/the-ethics-of-unpaid-labor-and-the-oss-community))
- A take home test like this allows people to do it in their own time and not have to take time off their current job
- It's lower pressure than having someone standing over your shoulder watching you code, so you can produce work closer to your personal standards.

## How we proceed after the screener is received
Once the screener has been submitted, we have one of the team review it. They're looking for things like readability of the code, separation of concerns, a reasonably thorough test suite etc. Depending on our workload at the time, this stage of the process can usually take a few days.

If we're impressed with what you've submitted, we'll set up some time to discuss your application further.

### Phone Screen / Face to face chat
This stage of the process is to discuss a bit about the role, what we're looking for, how you might be able to contribute, and give you a chance to ask any questions you have.

If you're based outside of Dublin, this stage will usually be done on Google Hangouts or over the phone. If you're based nearby, we prefer to just meet you in a local coffee shop.
