# Interviewing for a technical position at Kitman Labs
When you [apply for](https://kitman.workable.com) one of the technical positions at [Kitman Labs](http://kitmanlabs.com), the first step we ask you to complete is one of the screening questions in this repository. We do this for a few reasons -

- CVs / Resumes are usually a [pretty poor indicator](http://blog.alinelerner.com/resumes-suck-heres-the-data/) of how someone will do
- Most people don't have a publicly visible body of open source code we can refer to (and even if they did, relying on open source can [introduce bias](https://www.ashedryden.com/blog/the-ethics-of-unpaid-labor-and-the-oss-community))
- A take home test like this allows people to do it in their own time and not have to take time off their current job
- It's lower pressure than having someone standing over your shoulder watching you code, so you can produce work closer to your personal standards.

## How we proceed after the screener is received
Once the screener has been submitted, we have one of the team review it. They're looking for things like readability of the code, separation of concerns, a reasonably thorough test suite etc. Depending on our workload at the time, this stage of the process can usually take a few days.

If we're impressed with what you've submitted, we'll set up some time to discuss your application further.

### Phone Screen / Face to face chat
This stage of the process is to discuss a bit about the role, what we're looking for, how you might be able to contribute, and give you a chance to ask any questions you have.

If you're based outside of Dublin, this stage will usually be done on Google Hangouts or over the phone. If you're based nearby, we prefer to just meet you in a local coffee shop.

### Onsite Interviews
If you are asked to come to our offices for a full series of interviews, here's what to expect.

The onsite interview stage takes about 3 hours, involving 4 interviews of 45 minutes each. Every interviewer will be looking for something slightly different, but at a high level, it'll be something like this:

- **Screener Review:** In this interview, the interviewer will go over your the code you submitted earlier in the process. They'll be asking you why you made certain decisions, what other approaches you could have taken etc. There'll probably be a certain amount of whiteboarding here, but not whole programs or anything like that.
- **Previous Projects / System Design:** In this interview, the interviewer will be asking you questions about projects you've worked on in the past. How technical decisions were made, alternative approaches you could have taken etc.
- **Problem Solving:** In this interview we'll describe a problem and work together to whiteboard a solution. Despite the name, it's not about reversing binary trees or finding palindromes. It's about high level product problems. We're looking for you to clearly communicate your ideas about what classes/modules should have what responsibilities and why. While there are good and less good answers we're more interested in how you work and communicate. 
- **Culture:** We'll chat about some of the projects you've worked on, "tell me about a time" type questions. We want to find people who'll add to our culture. Someone who says "I know that's broken but it's not my job to fix it" is what we're looking to rule out here.
