Thanks for applying to Kitman Labs! Below you'll find our technical screener.

Once you've gone through this and sent us some answers, we'll have someone review it. That step can take a few days. Once that's complete, we'll set up a phone call with one of the team.

# About the screener
- When you're working on the coding questions, you should treat it like **real world production code**. We'll want to see a test suite, comments where required and things like that. It's important to **focus on the details**. It shouldn't feel like code you've hacked together in a rush, but something you'd be proud to have your name on.
- In terms of what programming language or frameworks to use, you should use whatever you feel is best suited to the task. Considering the position you're applying for, we would love to see Objective-C or Swift code, using Xcode or AppCode.
- We expect the tasks should take around two or three hours, but just let us know when you'll get it back to us and we'll be waiting. If you'd like to spend longer than three hours that's fine, but we don't expect you to - You have a life beyond this interview and that's completely reasonable!
- Hopefully it's a reasonably fun problem and shouldn't pose too much of a challenge. If you can give us a rough idea of when we should expect your answers, that would be great. We're pretty flexible on how you provide the answers. You can send over a link to a Github/Bitbucket repo; some folks send over a series of Github gists.

# Questions
- What's your proudest achievement? Something you've done in work, some random side project, code or otherwise. Just make sure you explain what it is that makes you so proud of it.
- What's the most interesting technical article you've read recently? What did you like about it and why should we take a look at it?
- Have a look at this Xcode playground [AlbumsArtists.swift](https://github.com/KitmanLabs/interview_screeners/blob/master/mobile-ios/AlbumsArtists.swift) (open with latest Xcode 8). You will see that it creates a table view controller showing a list of Artists and Albums, based on hard-coded data.
  - What do you find interesting about this code?
  - Modify this code so that it runs as an iOS app in the simulator and reads data from this JSON file [albums.json](https://github.com/KitmanLabs/interview_screeners/blob/master/mobile-ios/albums.json).
  - Modify the code that it shows a list of artists together with a list of the artist's albums.
